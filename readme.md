# OpenGL 3.3 Implementation of Jos Stam's Stable Fluids Demo

Jos Stam's original demo was written in C using GLUT for early versions of OpenGL. To begin learning real-time fluid simulation techniques I've begun by porting his demo to OpenGL 3.3, using [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org) and [GLAD](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad).

To run the demo, run `make` and execute `main`.

```
make
./main
```

## Goals
 - Convert boundary conditions from fixed to periodic - ***Done!***
 - Vary visuals based on density and/or velocity - ***Done!***
 - Expand simulation to three dimensions
 - Render in three dimensions
